You're here now, you can sit over there, but you won't be here then.

### My pitch

For centuries, humans have been able to chat with eachother via face to face, and then due to ugprades, we could use cellphones. But now with the internet, all face to face is lost, so the future is absent of humanity. 

My patent-pending idea is that all blogs have a face that you can talk to or imagine it's talking to you as you read the blog or email. 

Imagine receiving the following email from a colleague. It's much more personal:

##EMAIL INCOMING

HELLO FRIEND, THIS IS FRONK.

# Warm
## Warmer
### Warmest

REGARDS

##END OF EMAIL
